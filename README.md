# elections-real-story
The elections process & the election results in Israel were never so debatable in the past as they are now in the year 2019. The traces of the true story of the elections are hidden in the data. Go dig them to win your place among fighters for democracy. There is no greater honor than this!

Use your imgination to find questions that will lead us to the true story of the election. But if you are looking for ideas on what to do here are a few:

1. Enrich the data of the elections with data from other data resources that are open to the public (We added few resources on settlements)

2. Find anomalies: for example we found a case were the distribution of the votes for 2 distinct ballot (kalpi) was exactly the same. The odds that this happened by mistake are so slim it is most likely the result of a fraud (but correct us if you think we are wrong. You are the experts!!!). We also saw a lot of votes to Jewish religion parties in Arab settlements. If we could add data about the type of settelments to the original csv and than get final counts on votes for Jewish religion parties it will be most helpfull! We even saw ballots where the kosher votes plus ruled out votes don't add up to the total number of envelops that were extracted from the ballot. This is the case when someone from the ballot comettee added up some extra envelops during the count. There are big differences in the number of voters for local elections and national elections. Some difference is expected as the age for voting in local elextions is 17 while the age for voting in national elections is 18, but some settlements shows numbers that seems to high. Can you validate the differences against data about ages distribution in those settlements?

3. Compare the election results from 2019 to those of 2015. Were there settlement that shows a big shift to the extent that seems suspicious? Were there ballot were small parties get very high number of votes? 

4. Compare the official results to the results that were collected and entered by Tohar Behirot association volenteers (these results are still being collected and we will add them to this repository as soon as they are ready)
